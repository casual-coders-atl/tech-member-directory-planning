# User Stories

The following notes are loosely based on the book "Designing APIs with Swagger and OpenAPI" by Joshua S. Ponelat and Lukas L. Rosenstock (https://www.manning.com/books/designing-apis-with-swagger-and-openapi).

â€‹	User stories are generally written using the following template, but the "so that" clause is optional and the prefix, "as a <*role*>" will be omitted from each of the sections below for brevity:

```
As a <role>, I can <capability>, so that <receive_benefit>.
```

User stories that depend on other stories will use the following template:

```
Given <prerequisite>, I can <capability>.
```

- Given that I created a project, I can post project updates.
